INTRO

Console client lets you work with ABF without web-interface. It can manage git repositories, check build-task status, create new build-task and so on.

BUILD

--arch (-a), can be set more than once.

Architecture to build with. If not set,

--save-to-repository (-s)
Repository to save built packages to. Packages will be published here.


--commit (-c), --branch (-b) and --tag (-t)

API takes git commit hash to build. So client have to resolve it.
1) If you've specified hash - it will be used "as is".
2) If you've specified branch or tag name - it will be resolved automatically using ABF API. (the hash of top commit will be used for branch)
3) If you've specified no git commit related options and you've specified a project name - this project's default branch will be used.
4) If you've specified no git commit related options and you've not specified a project name (you have to be in a git repository) - the top remote commit of your current branch will be used.
